## 🌀 What is Atripout?

> Ever wished *Gartic Phone* and *TierMaker* had a beautiful, slightly deranged baby?  
>  
> **Atripout** is that baby.  
> It's a wild ride where you and your friends pass around a **tier list**, each person modifying it one turn at a time, until you've all collectively created... something.   
> Something glorious. Something cursed. Something uniquely yours.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Start a Game** – One person creates a room, picks a theme (e.g. "Fast Food Mascots", "Pokémon Types", "Types of Pain").
2. **Build the List** – Players add their own items to the tier list.
3. **Round-Robin Madness** – The tier list gets passed around. Each player can move one item per round.
4. **The Reveal** – When the chaos ends, everyone sees the final result... and questions each other’s life choices.
